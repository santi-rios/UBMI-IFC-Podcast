    "Structured Script Generation with Pydantic\n",
    "Inspired by the structured output in the Animated_Story_Video_Generation example, you can enforce a consistent, high-quality scientific structure for every podcast script. Using Pydantic with Gemini's JSON mode ensures that every script contains essential scientific sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization: Guarantees that every podcast follows a logical scientific narrative (Introduction, Methods, Results, Implications, Conclusion), which is crucial for clear communication.\n",
    "Reliability: Eliminates variability in the LLM's output, making the pipeline more robust and predictable.\n",
    "Modularity: Allows for easier post-processing, such as generating chapter markers for the podcast or creating summaries for each section."
