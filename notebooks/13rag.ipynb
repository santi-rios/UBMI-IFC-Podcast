    "Scientific Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deeper Context: Allows the LLM to generate a script that not only explains the new paper but also situates it within the broader research landscape of the institution or a specific lab.\n",
    "Authoritative Voice: By providing previous papers from the same authors or lab, the LLM can better adopt the specific terminology and perspective of that research group.\n",
    "Novelty Highlighting: The model can more effectively identify and emphasize what is truly novel about the new paper compared to previous work."
