    "4. **✅ Performance Metrics**: Speed and resource usage data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison with Other Methods:\n",
    "- **EmbeddingGemma**: High-quality, offline, 768D embeddings\n",
    "- **Google Gemini API**: High-quality but rate-limited, requires internet\n",
    "- **Local TF-IDF**: Fast but lower quality, 300D embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases:\n",
    "- **Production environments** where internet access is limited\n",
    "- **High-volume processing** without API costs\n",
    "- **Privacy-sensitive applications** requiring local processing\n",
    "- **Research applications** needing reproducible embeddings\n",
