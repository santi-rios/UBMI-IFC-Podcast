      "  \"abstract\": \"ABSTRACTAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising alternative to small-molecules-based antibiotics. These peptides are part of most living organisms' innate defense system. In order to computationally identify new AMPs within the peptides these organisms produce, an automatic AMP/non-AMP classifier is required. In order to have an efficient classifier, a set of robust features that can capture what differentiates an AMP from another that is not, has to be selected. However, the number of candidate descriptors is large (in the order of thousands) to allow for an exhaustive search of all possible combinations. Therefore, efficient and effective feature selection techniques are required. In this work, we propose an efficient wrapper technique to solve the feature selection problem for AMPs identification. The method is based on a Genetic Algorithm that uses a variable-length chromosome for representing the selected features and uses an objective function that considers the Mathew Correlation Coefficient and the number of selected features. Computational experiments show that the proposed method can produce competitive results regarding sensitivity, specificity, and MCC. Furthermore, the best classification results are achieved by using only 39 out of 272 molecular descriptors.\",\n",

      " abstract = {ABSTRACTPurpose: The production of Technosols is a sustainable strategy to reuse urban wastes and to regenerate degraded sites. However, little is known regarding the role of the activity of enzymes associated with carbon and nutrients cycling on organic degradation and microbial activity in these soils. Methods: A controlled experiment was conducted with Technosols made from construction wastes, wood chips, and compost or compost plus biochar, in order to evaluate their organic matter (OM) degradation potential and functioning through the activity of enzymes and microbial community composition. Results: The Technosols had organic carbon contents from 13 to 30 g kg−1, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio from 10 to 20, and available phosphorus from 92 to 376 mg kg−1. The Technosols with biochar and compost had alkaline pH and higher contents of organic carbon and available phosphorus compared to Technosols with compost alone. The mixture of wood chips and compost presented the highest enzyme activities, and might be the most appropriate for Technosol’s production. The mixture of concrete and excavation waste with compost and compost plus biochar displayed a potential for OM decomposition comparable to that of wood chips with compost plus biochar. These results suggest that the bacterial and archaeal fingerprint is similar among the Technosols, although differences are observed in the relative abundances of their taxa. Conclusions: Substrate composition affects the processes of OM transformation, microbial biomass activity, and composition. The mixture of wood chips and compost presented the highest enzyme activities during the incubation period, and might be the most appropriate for its application as a Technosol. The mixture of concrete and excavation waste with either compost or compost plus biochar displayed a potential for organic matter decomposition that was comparable to that of the mixture of wood chips with compost plus biochar. The microbial communities in these Technosols are not significantly different yet, but the bioavailability of nutrients derived from the changes in the soil matrix (by adding construction waste and biochar) is influencing soil enzymatic activity.},\n",
